Crossfabric is a library that mods can use to integrate multiversion easily!

- Crossfabric is currently in **beta** and only supports **client-side Fabric mods** for now.  
- Server-side support is planned for a future update.

The [wiki](https://github.com/xNasuni/Crossfabric/wiki) contains information on the tools crossfabric provides.
